Task:

Practise what we've done this week using JavaScript in the browser:

    Fetch information from an API.
    Display/Analyse the information in the browser using DOM manipulation/maps/canvas etc. Be creative!

GitHub user toddmotto maintains a HUGE list of links to open APIs on many subjects. We strongly recommend that you avoid APIs which require OAuth authentication. APIs which are listed as requiring an apiKey require a little bit of extra work, but this should be documented by the API itself.

In particular we recommend:

    REST countries: https://restcountries.eu/
    Football Data: http://api.football-data.org/index - Make sure you sign up for a Free API key to use in your requests otherwise you may get CORS errors in Chrome.
    OMDB - Film info: http://www.omdbapi.com/ - no key needed.
    News API: https://newsapi.org/ - News stories from several different sources
    Giphy API: https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI - fun gifs! Free key provided.
    Open Weather Map: http://openweathermap.org/api - Free API key on sign up.
    Harry Potter: http://hp-api.herokuapp.com/
    MusixMatch: https://developer.musixmatch.com/ - get info on music charts, artists and their music, lyrics. Free API key when you sign up.
